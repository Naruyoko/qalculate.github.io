	<h4>.: 2017-08-28 :. Qalculate! version 2.0 released</h4>
	After a month of hard work Qalculate! version 2.0 is ready with removal of glib and cln dependencies from the library, a redesigned expression entry and keypad in the GUI, and a new feature complete Windows version. Get the new version from the <a href="downloads.html">downloads page</a>.<br><br>
	List of main changes:
	<ul>
		<li>CLN has been replaced with GMP and MPFR for low-level numerical calculations.</li>
		<li>The Glib dependancy has been removed. It has partly been replaced with libiconv and icu. Libqalculate can be compiled without them and libiconv is only used the CLI application.</li>
		<li>GVFS and wget have been replaced by libcurl for exchange rates retrieval.</li>
		<li>Date functions have been rewritten and now support much larger numbers.</li>
		<li>Trigonometric functions with angle unit other than radians have been fixed.</li>
		<li>Functions with more than one argument can now also be applied to the RPN stack, and enter on empty expression duplicates the stack register at the top.</li>
		<li>New functions: airy(), arg(), besselj(), bessely(), conj(), digamma(), erf(), erfc()</li>
		<li>Redesigned keypad with a lot more functionality. (GUI)</li>
		<li>Multiline expression entry with undo/redo. (GUI)</li>
		<li>Alternative simplified function creation dialog. (GUI)</li>
		<li>Percentage calculation tool. (GUI)</li>
		<li>Binary installer for Microsoft Windows.</li>
		<li>Increased efficiency and many minor enhancements and bug fixes.</li>
	</ul>
	For a complee list of changes see the ChangeLogs (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qalculate/libqalculate/v2.0.0/ChangeLog">libqalculate</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qalculate/qalculate-gtk/v2.0.0a/ChangeLog">qalculate-gtk</a>), or, for even more details, git logs (<a href="https://github.com/Qalculate/libqalculate/commits/v2.0.0">libqalculate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Qalculate/qalculate-gtk/commits/v2.0.0a">qalculate-gtk</a>).
	<h4>.: 2017-08-09 :. Preview of the first official Windows version of Qalculate! released</h4>
	Qalculate! has long been available for GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, but now it is finally also compatible with Microsoft Windows (although there is a fork by Cheng Sun with Windows compatibility, which has contributed code to this version). This pre-release version is likely not as stable as version 1.0.0 (although it does include some important bug fixes), but you are nevertheless invited to try it, report any issues you find and share you opinion. 
	<br><br>Download the installer here: <a href="https://github.com/Qalculate/libqalculate/releases/download/v1.0.99/qalculate-1.0.99.msi">qalculate-1.0.99.msi</a>.
	<h4>.: 2017-07-24 :. Qalculate! version 1.0 released</h4>
	Qalculate! version 1.0 includes the following changes:
	<ul>
		<li>Increased efficiency and stability. Slow calculations can in most cases now be terminated in a controlled manner and the application should no longer potentially crash when trying to calculate extremely large numbers.</li>
		<li>Enhanced factorization.</li>
		<li>Revised temperature unit handling.</li>
		<li>Enhanced automatic unit conversion, including a new default mode which keeps original non-SI units if no better alternative (that uses fewer units and exponents) is found.</li>
		<li>A long list of bug fixes and minor feature enhancements.</li>
	</ul>
	For a complete list of changes see the git logs for <a href="https://github.com/Qalculate/libqalculate/commits/v1.0.0a">libqalculate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Qalculate/qalculate-gtk/commits/v1.0.0">qalculate-gtk</a>.
	<h4>.: 2017-05-29 :. Qalculate! version 0.9.12 released</h4>
	Qalculate! version 0.9.12 includes fixes to unit parsing in <i>adaptive parsing mode</i>, build fixes and other minor bug fixes. The fork with support for Microsoft Windows has been merged (compilation on Windows has however not been tested).
	<h4>.: 2017-03-06 :. Qalculate! version 0.9.11 released</h4>
	Qalculate! version 0.9.11 includes both some important bug fixes and a number of new features. Among other things mixed units conversion has been added and users of the graphical user interface will notice the new enhanced history view. The RPN functionality has received much needed attention and should now be more usable.
	<br><br>Changes:
	<ul>
		<li>Mixed units conversion (e.g. "15 in = 1 ft + 3 in" and "3,2 h = 3 h + 12 min")</li>
		<li>Fixes to unit conversion (e.g. "1/(1 ns) to GHz")</li>
		<li>Fix slow calculation of exponentiations with big numerators in exponents (e.g. "2^0.333333333")</li>
		<li>Critical fixes for RPN syntax</li>
		<li>Fix degree sign</li>
		<li>Fix transformation of last arguments to vector, when only one last argument (fixes function("1+\x"; 1))</li>
		<li>Plot functions (makes possible plotting, using gnuplot, in qalc)</li>
		<li>"Swap, "pop", "copy", "rotate" and "move" commands for RPN stack manipulation in qalc</li>
		<li>Enable both (or one of) RPN stack and syntax with the "rpn" command in qalc</li>
		<li>New commands for creation of simple functions and variables (without calculation of the expression) in qalc</li>
		<li>Updated history view. The calculation log is now presented in an actual list. Buttons and functions have been added for calculation with previous expression and results (GTK+ UI)</li>
		<li>Enhanced RPN stack manipulation (swap, rotation and copy) and arithmetics buttons next to stack list and combine RPN options in a single menu (GTK+ UI)</li>
		<li>Calculation of text in spinboxes for integer function arguments (GTK+ UI)</li>
		<li>Option to use multiple instances by default (GTK+ UI)</li>
		<li>Various other minor enhancements and bug fixes...</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>.: 2016-08-28 :. Qalculate! version 0.9.10 released</h4>
	Qalculate! version 0.9.10 includes a small number of important bug fixes. Only libqalculate has been updated.
	<br><br>Changes:
	<ul>
		<li>Unit conversion fixes (e.g. "1/s to ms" and "1/ns to GHz")</li>
		<li>Fixed parsing of degrees sign (used in defult symbol for temperature units)</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>.: 2016-07-26 :. Qalculate! version 0.9.9 released</h4>
	Qalculate! version 0.9.9 is a minor release with some important bug fixes, as well as a few new features.
	<br><br>Changes:
	<ul>
		<li>libqalculate will no longer cause segmentation faults when using a locale unsupported by the users system</li>
		<li>Parsing of "today" fixed and "tomorrow" and "yesterday" added</li>
		<li>Qalculate! now compiles, without errors and warning, using clang</li>
		<li>Only a single instance of the GUI will run by default (use command line switch '-n' for old behaviour)</li>
		<li>New commands/options in qalc which list available variables, functions and units</li>
		<li>New command in qalc for deletion of variables</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>.: 2016-06-15 :. Qalculate! version 0.9.8 released</h4>
	After almost a decade of very little development, the project has been revived and during the last two months many improvements have been made, until it is now time to release a new version. Qalculate! version 0.9.8 includes many bug fixes, but due to limited testing some new bugs have probably been introduced. Any external applications using libqalculate need to be recompiled to function properly with the new version.
	<br><br>Changes:
	<ul>	
		<li>Lots of bug fixes and minor improvements</li>
		<li>Three different parsing modes can be chosen from (providing mainly different handling of implicit multiplication). The default 'adaptive' mode has been enhanced.</li>
		<li>By default prefixes will not be added to for example imperial units.</li>				
		<li>Changed handling of degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit. Conversion will take place already during parsing.</li>
		<li>When converting to unit without prefix, no prefix will be added to the result unless the unit expression is prepended with '?' ('0' works in the opposite direction).</li>
		<li>Option to ignore commas in numbers (for use as thousands separator).</li>
		<li>Possibility to abort slow number printing without using crash prone thread cancellation (use Calculator::startPrintControl() and related functions).</li>
		<li>New function: fibonacci (Qalculate! can now tell you that the millionth fibonacci number is approximately 1,953282129 * 10^208987, although for obvious reasons the exact number cannot be displayed).</li>
		<li>New units: Hartree, Rydberg, Dalton (same as u).</li>
		<li>Physical constant have been updated with the CODATA values from 2014.</li>
		<li>Currencies have been updated to reflect the available data from ECB.</li>				
		<li>Use ~/.local and ~/.conf to store configuration and definitions</li>
		<li>The GTK+ UI has been ported to GTK+ 3 and has been polished in the process.</li>
		<li>The convert dialog has been transformed into a tab page in the main window, with auto-selection of unit category and continuous conversion. (GTK+ UI)</li>
		<li>Less obtrusive display of errors and warnings. They are now shown as tooltips for an icon next to the expression entry. (GTK+ UI)</li>
		<li>Spinners show calculation/display progress and an icon in the expression entry halts the process, instead of a message dialog. (GTK+ UI)</li>
		<li>A tooltip for the result display will show the result in text format less open to interpretation. (GTK+ UI)</li>		
		<li>Better resizing of main windows. Tabs will be resized instead of result display and keypad view will remember size independently of the history view. (GTK+ UI)</li>
		<li>'to' can now not only be used for conversion to unit expressions. "to bin", "to oct", "to hex" and "to bases" changes number base displayed, "to factors" factorizes, "to fraction" displays as fraction, and "to base" and "to optimal" auto-converts units. (CLI and GTK+ UI)</li>
		<li>The KDE UI has been abandoned for now and is not included in this release.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>.: 2016-04-30 :. A new version coming soon...</h4>
	The graphical user interface has been ported to GTK+ 3 (unfortunately the KDE version has been abandoned for now) and lots of bugs have been fixed.

	<h4>.: 2005-10-11 :. Quick fix for result cropping in new pango</h4>
	The gtk+ version of <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! was updated to handle new behaviour
	in pango &gt;= 1.10.0.
	<h4>.: 2005-10-10 :. New Applications: <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! Bases, <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! Currency, <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! Units</h4>
	In some cases the big (bloated) <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! application is not the most efficient and user friendly interface.
	Why should you, for example, need to load and learn to use the full application just to convert a simple binary number to a decimal, or
	to see what the price of a foreign product is in your national currency with the current exchange rates. 
	Therefore, I am now releasing three small utilities: <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! Bases,
	<font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! Currency, and <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! Units.
	The full libqalculate capabilities is of course available in these applications (arbitrary precision, expression evaluation, etc.), but in
	graphical user interfaces more fine-tuned for the specific purposes. The <a href="screenshots.html#qalclets">screenshots</a> should be self-explanatory.
	<h4>.: 2005-10-10 :. <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! version 0.8.2</h4>
	A new full release with mostly bug fixes.
	<br><br>Changelog:
	<ul>
		<li>Use gnomevfs instead of wget if available</li>
		<li>Allow user to specify wget options</li>
		<li>Add -export-dynamic to LDFLAGS to fix libglade without libgnome</li>
		<li>Update currencies</li>
		<li>Close gnuplot and disable save button when no series defined (GTK+)</li>
		<li>Fix round halfway numbers to even menu item (KDE)</li>
		<li>Also process operators entered with keypad (KDE)</li>
		<li>System tray icon and close to system tray option (of by default, KDE)</li>
		<li>Do not create qalculate symlink to qalc (confusing when installing GUI in other location)</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>.: 2005-09-22 :. lib<font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! version 0.8.1.2</h4>
	This is a bug fix release of libqalculate.
	<br><br>Changelog:
	<ul>
		<li>Fix (1/2)^n &lt; 0.5 in equalities (bug #1265104)</li>
		<li>Fix transformation of unicode signs in expressions with quotes</li>
		<li>Fix conversion of 0 &ordm;C to &ordm;F</li>
		<li>New units: mph and mpg</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>.: 2005-06-11 :. <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! version 0.8.1.1</h4>
	The purpose if this release is to check and lower the version numbers of required libraries.
	Some additional enhancements did however sneak in... qalculate-gtk has not been updated but needs to
	be recompiled if libqalculate is updated.
	<br><br>Changelog:
	<ul>
		<li>Remove requirement glib-2.0 >= 2.4 and require libxml2 >= 2.3.8</li>

	The element data is rather limited at moment and I'm not exactly a chemist, so if someone is willing to step
	forward and fill in the missing properties I would very much appreciate it. I could also use some more suggestions 
	on functions that you think should be included, how the user interface can become more user-friendly, and any 
	new features that would be useful.

	<h4>.: 2004-06-23 :. <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! version 0.6 finally released</h4>
	This release features completely rewritten math structures, including how expressions are represented, simplified and calculated internally.
	This means that all known bugs and mathematical errors have been fixed, and hopefully results in much improved reliability. 
	As almost no code was left untouched, a bunch of new bugs should however be expected.
	<br><br>User visible changes include
	<ul>
		<li>Correct calculations :-)</li>
		<li>Selectable assumptions and definition of separate unknown variables</li>
		<li>Some infinity support</li>
		<li>Some new and changed variables and functions (some removed)</li>
		<li>New result drawing routines</li>
		<li>Exact mode -> "Always Exact", "Try Exact" and "Approximate" approximation choices</li>
		<li>Fixed plotting</li>
		<li>Multiplication sign selection</li>
		<li>New boolean entry</li>
		<li>Do not create a new thread (and stack space) for every calculation</li>
		<li>...</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>.: 2004-05-12 :. Status Update</h4>
	Relatively long time has gone by since the last release, but this does not mean that development has stalled. 
	I am currently rewriting the core math code, including how expressions are represented, simplified and calculated internally.
	<br><br>The rewrite will take some time, but will hopefully result in much improved reliability. Some functionality will be lost in the process
	and some will be added, such as assumptions (although the current version makes some inconsistent on its own) and display of the actual expression calculated, but most 
	user-visible features will remain unchanged. Also, the API will be closer to being ready for a separate library release.
	<br><br>I seriously considered fully moving to Giac, but found that it was still lacking the stability needed for 
	a desktop application and I also felt that I was moving too far a way from the main purpose 
	of <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate!, which is to be a user-friendly and
	efficient tool for a wide array of everyday and simple scientific calculations. Those who need a full CAS will probably
	be more efficient with the tools provided with Giac.
	<h4>.: 2004-04-06 :. <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! version 0.5.1</h4>
	This version includes some important bug fixes (mostly related to trigonometric functions and multiple roots) 
	and a new solve function.

	<ul>
		<li>Fix multiple real roots as far as possible</li>
		<li>Fix polynomial division (sin() / tan() was broken)</li>
		<li>Fix trigonometric function units</li>
		<li>Equation solver independent of Giac and isolation of x in comparisons</li>
		<li>Fix comparison of approximate values</li>
		<li>Elasticity and extremum functions</li>
		<li>Do not display any extra trailing zeros</li>
		<li>Fix invocation of newly created function</li>

	<h4>.: 2004-03-29 :. <font color="#cc4499"><strong>Q</strong></font>alculate! version 0.5</h4>
	This version includes a relatively large number of feature enhancements and fixes.
